# MullyMelee
Simultate the Mully Melee scenario laid out in the [Fall 2019 THACHER magazine](https://www.thacher.org/explore/thacher-today/magazine/fall-2019) (p. 3) 

To run the simulation, simply download the `MullyMeleeSimulation.py` file. You can run this file in several ways, the simplest being:
1) Open the Terminal
2) Navigate to the folder where you put `MullyMeleeSimulation.py`
3) Enter the command `python3 MullyMeleeSimulation.py`

This should launch an interaction that looks like:
```
How many seats should there be in the Mully? <Type the Num. of Seats>
How many times would you like to simulate? <Type the Num. of Simulations>
Simulating...
Avg. Freq. of Last Seat Available: <Prints the Answer>
```

The other file, `MullyMeleeExact.py` solves for the exact odds recursively, but there is no nice user interface
