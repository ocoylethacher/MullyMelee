# MullyMelee
Simultate the Mully Melee scenario laid out in the THACHER magazine

To run the simulation, simply download the `MullyMelee.py` file. You can run this file in several ways, the simplest being:
1) Open the Terminal
2) Navigate to the folder where you put `MullyMelee.py`
3) Enter the command `python3 MullyMelee.py`

This should launch an interaction that looks like:
```
How many seats should there be in the Mully? *Num. of Seats*
How many times would you like to simulate? *Num. of Simulations*
Simulating...
Avg. Freq. of Last Seat Available: *Answer*
```
